						<h1>From the first stop to the end of the line,</h1>
						<h2>Shipping a bus with ShipLux is the way to go!</h2>
						<p>Bus. Shuttle. Motorcoach. Trolley. People movers are everywhere, shuttling every segment of the population. City buses, church buses, school buses, shuttle buses, prison buses, tour buses, minibuses, and double deckers all serve one purpose: they haul people from place to place in economical style.</p>
						<p>But when the bus is what needs hauling, the necessary details of the transport can start to add up, leaving a confusing mess of routes, permits, and methods.</p>
						<p>Trust the logistics experts at ShipLux to help you untangle the situation. ShipLux is the leader in vehicle transport, and our bus shipping service has you covered. Our experience includes priceless luxury antique autos, heavy-duty industrial mining equipment, and everything in between. When you need to ship a bus, ShipLux has the solution.</p>
						<h2>The Challenges of Shipping a Bus</h2>
						<p>Buses of all descriptions are the go-to choice for moving groups of people, but transporting a bus can be complicated. Exceptionally long, tall, wide, and weighty, buses are oversize loads needing special attention during transport. Most buses utilize a long and low design to enhance maneuverability and capacity. Unfortunately, this often leaves the undercarriage susceptible to damage during loading and unloading.</p>
						<p>While minibuses and smaller charter buses may fit comfortably on a standard trailer, shipping a bus generally means specialized equipment. Articulated buses exist because bus lengths can be challenging to maneuver along narrow city streets. Already impressive, the length of a bus can become a bigger concern once loaded onto a trailer! Taller buses, such as tour buses and double deckers, may already be pushing against height restrictions for many domestic roads, and adding the height of the trailer bed can make planning an overland route problematic.</p>
						<p>Domestic roads, particularly in residential areas, can limit cargo width availability, often requiring additional permits or escort vehicles. Weight restrictions affect the choice of the trailer for bus shipping and the appropriate routes.</p>
						<p>Save yourself the headache and trust the logistics experts at ShipLux to provide you with a door-to-door bus shipping service that covers all the details.</p>
						<h2>ShipLux Ships Any Type of Bus</h2>
						<p>Buses range from small utilitarian transports to sprawling mansion-on-wheels trailers suitable for the biggest stars in Hollywood. Every bus transport presents a unique shipping challenge that can feel as big as a bus! Finding the proper bus shipping service can be a weighty task. The right company must be licensed, bonded, and insured. They must have extensive experience shipping a bus.</p>
						<p>They have to have the right people and equipment for the job, and they should help with the details like planning the route and preparing the necessary paperwork.</p>
						<p>Shipping a bus presents challenges. Fortunately, ShipLux provides the right solutions. ShipLux goes the extra mile for you. Your dedicated logistics agent is available around the clock and will be there with you at every stop.
